# chatbox

Chatbox is a web application that allows users to register, login, and chat with one another. 

# features implemented

Users can register accounts to a database, login to those accounts, and then use those accounts to chat in the chatbox page. 
Features I'd like to implement later is proper use of ip detection and admin priveleges. An admin would be able to delete accounts and mute people temporarily. 

# Setup
Setup is done with AWS, K8s, and nginx. AWS is used to host K8s, and for creating a database instance. Nginx will be installed onto the K8s cluster to handle ingress routing.
